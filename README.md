## Technologies
The project is created with:
* Python 2.7 or 3.6
* Arduino programming language
* [ROS](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Installation)

## Requirements
To be able to test our code, there are a few requirements.

### Hardware
* [RaceCar](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/9d3f435f340b50b281de3ac4/w/60d94a6915ed0711b2290521/e/45c11c7ee9e7e6dfaec5c7e5) of the UniversitÃ© de Sherbrooke
* Logitech Wireless Gamepad F710 (DirectInput Mode)

### Software
* For Raspberry Pi 3 on RaceCar, we provide a RPI3 image with everything already installed, see this [page](https://github.com/SherbyRobotics/racecar/tree/master/images#restore-raspberrypi3-image) to flash your RPI3. To do it manually, see this [section](https://github.com/SherbyRobotics/racecar/tree/master/images#create-raspberrypi3-image).
* For Desktop/Laptop development, see this [section](https://github.com/SherbyRobotics/racecar/tree/master/images#virtual-machine) to setup ROS in a virtual machine or in a dual boot with Ubuntu 18.04.

## How it works
![](https://github.com/SherbyRobotics/racecar/blob/master/doc/Racecar_rqt_graph_teleop.png "teleop" )
In the graph, you can see a representation of the communication between the nodes and the topics on the base launch file [teleop.launch](https://github.com/SherbyRobotics/racecar/blob/master/racecar_bringup/launch/teleop.launch). 

The RaceCar has many operating modes that allow you to test different functionnalities. The ROS controller Node, which control commands to the motor and the steering servo, has multiple high-level mode that are selected by joystick inputs (see [Controller modes](#controller-modes) table for more details). For instance, open-loop, closed-loop in velocity, closed-loop in position modes are available for both the propulsion and the steering.  The Arduino has also multiple internal low-level modes (different than the high-level ones!!!) that are selected by the ROS controller Node. Empty operating mode templates are available in the source code for you to test custom control modes.

## Launch
1. Follow those [instructions](https://github.com/SherbyRobotics/racecar/tree/master/images#restore-raspberrypi-image) to flash your Raspberry Pi with a pre-built image, or follow those [instructions](https://github.com/SherbyRobotics/racecar/tree/master/images#create-raspberrypi-image) to setup from scratch.
2. Connect the battery to Raspberry Pi. If installed as instructions above, you can connect your laptop by Wi-Fi on RaceCar's hotspot. Launch VNC from your laptop and connect to `10.42.0.1` (Raspberry Pi's IP). 
2. Flash the Arduino (need to be done only 1 time):
    1. Connect the Arduino mega 2560 of the RaceCar to Raspberry Pi if not already done.
    2. Flash the Arduino mega 2560 with the firmware file [racecar_propulsion_firmware.ino](https://github.com/SherbyRobotics/racecar/tree/master/racecar_arduino/racecar_propulsion_firmware) using Arduino IDE (with Tools->Board: select "Arduino Mega or Mega 2560" as target).
3. Turn on the motors by flipping the switch on the left side of the car. A green light will turn on.
4. From a terminal (`ctrl+alt+t`), launch ROS with the launch file [teleop.launch](https://github.com/SherbyRobotics/racecar/tree/master/racecar_bringup/launch/teleop.launch):
    ```bash
    $ roslaunch racecar_bringup teleop.launch
    ```
5. To visualize the racecar in rviz:
    ```bash
    $ roslaunch racecar_bringup rviz.launch
    ```

6. Enable the joystick by performing an input combination below to start.
7. Enjoy!

## High-level Controller Modes

Note: LB is used as a deadman switch and must be always pressed for the car to operate. Make sure the switch mode behind the gamepad is on D and not X. 

Mode | Input sequence | Function
-|-|-
1|`LB`| Closed-loop velocity, open-loop steering
2|`LB` + `RB`|Fully Open-loop
3|`LB` + `A`|Closed-loop position, open-loop steering
4|`LB` + `B`|Closed-loop velocity, closed-loop steering
5|`LB` + `X`|Closed-loop velocity, closed-loop steering
6|`LB` + `Y`|Reset encoder command
7|`LB` + `LT`|Joystick disabled
8|`LB` + `Croos key Up/Down`|Template
9|None|Nothing (a zero command is sent to vehicle)
